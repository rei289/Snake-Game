# Snake-Game
This snake game is like any ordinary snake game, except it can be played as a singleplayer or multiplayer! For singleplayer, it is pretty self-explanitory; you play by yourself. For multiplayer, you can either play against the computer (not an AI but a simple object finding algorithm) or with one of your friends. Note that to switch the multiplayer mode, you have to physically correct the code (more information in the "Notes about code" section). </br>

## Instllation (mac)
### Python

1. Download package from this website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Once downloaded, open package and follow instructions 
3. Using an IDE will significantly make your life easier in running and modifying the code. Examples of good IDE include PyCharm, Wing (IDE I used to run this code), Spyder

## Notes about code
1. To run this game, you need to install 3 python libraries: pygame, sys, random
2. The code is currently set to play against the computer. If you wish to play with someone else, comment out code from line 646-668 and uncomment code from line 617-644
3. To change the speed of the snake, change number in line 344
4. This version of snake game is not optimized in anyway, rather it focuses on more of the creativity aspect of the game (allowing singleplayer and multiplayer capabilities)


## How the code works
If you are interested in knowing how the code works, there are comments written in the code briefly describing most of the line in the code. However, for a more in-depth description of the code, here is a description of the code:
