# Snake-Game
**How game works** </br>
This snake game can be played as a singleplayer or multiplayer. For the singleplayer option, you will be playing by yourself. For the multiplayer option, you can either play against the computer (not an AI but simple object finding algorithm) or you can play with another player.

**Notes about code**
1. To run this game, you need to install 3 python libraries: pygame, sys, random
2. The code is currently set to play against the computer. If you wish to play with someone else, comment out code from line 646-668 and uncomment code from line 617-644
3. To change the speed of the snake, change number in line 344

**Enjoy!**
